# MealMancer Frontend
Meal Mancer is an AI-powered RESTful API service that helps users quickly create recipes based on the ingredients in their cupboards, with a fun twist â€” the entire application is themed around sorcery! When a user inputs the ingredients they have, the app uses an AI model to generate a recipe. When interacting with the application, the AI is treated as a wizard, enhancing user experience and engagement.  

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [Meal Mancer](https://mealmancer.netlify.app/)

â€» Most functionalities will display dummy data since the backend server is down for now.

## Key Features
â€» Users need to be authenticated in order to access the AI service.
- The wizard AI model reads the user-input ingredients and returns a recipe.
- If a user enjoys a particular recipe, they can add it to their favourites for easy access.
- Each user is granted 20 tokens, which represent how many times the user can use the AI service for free.
- Admins can view all users and their remaining tokens, with the ability to edit all user information.
